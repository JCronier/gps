### Welcome to the GPS points finder!

I made this with Python's Pandas and Numpy, along with the ARCGIS api. I travelled for work and decided to make this app to calculate the total number of kilometers I drove per year,
in order to write off my vehicle expenses come tax season!

Clone the repo, run the scripts, input a CSV generated by Quikbooks' Time mobile app and enjoy!
